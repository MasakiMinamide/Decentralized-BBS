#### This BBS is using **Ropsten** blockchain as a database. You need to use a browser with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) installed. 

 Use only when you understand nature of blockchain and confirm that your __metamask__ is connected to Ropsten network. 
 Any transaction mistakenly completed are on your responsibility. 

#### Server running on http://d-bbc.dx.am/


##### Please bear the ugliness of the code and UI. Next time, I will use React or some kind of framework and add more interactivity!
